# CS61A
Course #2 in my Journey to a Masters in CS

I am Undertaking a survey of CS61A in which I will read, and watch the lectures, attempt the exams, and complete the projects.
the intent is NOT to complete EVERY single discussion, homework, and lab but to get learn, understand, and be able to apply the content
in an acelerated method.

This course is being completed after completing a survey of MIT 6.0001 which is where I began this journey
